  Welcome to M&L Co !
  <h2> Maze Project Description</h5>
    The project is to build a maze on a web page and be able to make mazes of different difficult levels
  (options include easy, medium, hard and difficult). A countdown timer is added on it and see if the
  player can beat the time before it reaches zero. Make it interesting by adding hidden holes in it
  using a randomizer. When the player steps on a hidden hole, the player are transported to
  another part of the maze. As the designers, you can do is to add treasure items in the maze so
  that the player can pick things up along the way. This makes traversing the maze more fun but it.
